# ZERO // CYBERSECURITY PORTFOLIO

> No System is secure.

A **security-first, hacker-oriented portfolio website** built to represent technical depth, mindset, and discipline — not marketing noise.

This project is intentionally minimal, static, and dependency-light.

---

## ⚠️ Philosophy

Security is not a feature.  
Privacy is not optional.  
Complexity is a liability.

This website exists to present **signal, not decoration**.

---

## 🧠 What This Is

- A professional digital identity for a cybersecurity engineer
- A static portfolio with **zero dynamic attack surface**
- A controlled environment — no backend, no trackers, no analytics
- A place to showcase skills, tools, and real projects without dilution

---

## 🧩 Core Characteristics

- Fully static architecture
- Vanilla HTML / CSS / JavaScript only
- Dark cyber-themed UI with restrained visual effects
- Responsive by design
- Clean semantic structure
- Easy to audit, fork, and extend

## 🔐 Security Notes

- No backend endpoints
- No form handling
- No third-party scripts beyond fonts/icons
- Minimal JavaScript footprint
- Reduced fingerprinting surface

Designed to be **inspectable**, not impressive.
